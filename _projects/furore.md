In this project, we investigate runtime monitoring under uncertainty. Technically, we consider a white-box setting where we are given a Markov model of the system and aim to extract all sequences of events that should be classified as dangerous.

Summary for the general public
------------------------------
Many systems in our every-day life become smarter every year, Being smart and dependable also requires that a system knows what it cannot do and warns the user if it gets in such a situation, much like dashboard lights warn a driver about the state of a vehicle. In this project, researchers study algorithms that decide when to flash a dashboard light for a variety of systems. The challenge is to adequately handle the uncertainty in the system. The project focusses on the creation of efficient and understandable algorithms.

Funding Information
-------------------
The project is funded by an NWO ENW M-1 Grant. The funding amounts to 360k over 4 years (2024-2028).
