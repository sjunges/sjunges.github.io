In this project, we aim to improve the usability of our open source model checker Storm.


Summary for the general public
------------------------------

Probabilistic model checking is a popular technique to analyse models that describe systems subject to uncertainty. The open-source tool Storm is a competitive, widely applied model checker, which was originally designed for model checking experts. Due to its success, the type of users and the typical use cases have broadened, however, this is not yet reflected in the interfaces or documentation that Storm provides. StormAE aims to improve in these two areas to ensure that more researchers can rely on the latest algorithms in Storm, compare them to new methods, and apply them in the wider scientific field.

Funding Information
-------------------
The project is funded by an NWO Open Science Fund.
The funding amounts to 50k over 1 years (2024-2025).
