Bachelor and Master projects
----------------------------
I always look forward and enjoy to working with motivated students. I often have some concrete ideas, but I am also happy to hear your ideas!
Please also see my [research interests](../research) for some potential areas. 

### General topics
I am always interested in help to understand and improve state-of-the-art algorithms in the area of probabilistic model checking and model-based reinforcement learning. 

Most of the topics I supervise are accompanied by creating new implementations of existing or new algorithms and thus require some programming expertise, preferably in C++ or Python. However, for many topics, a willingness to learn during the project suffices.
I also offer purely theoretical topics, in particular, I am interested in complexity results for the topics mentioned above. 

#### New topics (broadly)
- Model-based runtime monitoring to develop algorithms that reason whether a system is in a safe state. 
- Using ideas from probabilistic inference to speed up verification
- Connecting verification engines with simulation engines for robotics and autonomous system
