*This website is under construction*

I am a researcher and have been a PostDoc at UC Berkeley since March 2020. I am part of the Learn and Verify Group, headed by Sanjit Seshia. 

Previously, I was a PhD student at [RWTH Aachen University](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/), under the supervision of Joost-Pieter Katoen. 
I defended my PhD thesis titled [Parameter Synthesis in Markov Models](http://doi.org/10.18154/RWTH-2020-02348) [(pdf)](http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/783179/files/783179.pdf) in February 2020.

## Research Interest

I am broadly interested in the automatic analysis of critical systems. 
This interest includes both modelling and verification aspects. 
In particular, I am interested in the analysis of models that explicitly model uncertainty.  

I often work with probabilstic model checkers and SAT/SMT solvers and analyze extensions of Markov decision processes (MDPs),
in particular also parametric or partially observable MDPs. My research is largely driven by the development and implementation of algorithms.
